# Cone Optimization
This Python project was built using the [DEAP](https://github.com/deap/deap) evolutionary computation framework. This is an application of an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm to find the best radius and height values of a cone to maximize its volume and minimize its surface area. 

### Files
This repository contains one Python file and one image file, "cones.py" and "objective_space.png". In the "cones.py" file, we aim to generate a set of cones with maximal volume and minimal surface area. The "objective_space.png" file, shown below, is a plot of the volumes and surface areas of possible solutions. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IshawnGullapalli/cone-optimization/main/objective_space.png)

The data points in green are Pareto optimal. The data points in black are simply other solutions which are not optimal.

### The Process
The process of finding the Pareto optimal radius and height values is fairly simple. We use the `eaMuPlusLambda` algorithm provided by the DEAP framework. To use this algorithm, we need to define the following: the fitness of an individual, the process for crossing two individuals, the process of mutating an individual, and the process of selecting which elements move on to the next generation.
1. Calculating Fitness
    - The process of calculating the fitness of an individual is quite simple. 
    - The fitness is simply a tuple containing the volume and the surface area of the individual.
2. Crossing Individuals
    - The crossover process is also simple.
    - We simply switch the radius and the height of the two parent individuals.
3. Mutating Individuals
    - The mutation process is provided by the DEAP framework.
    - Given a predefined probability, the current individual's radius and height are replaced by new randomly generated values.
4. Selecting Individuals
    - The selection process is also already implemented by DEAP.
    - In this project, we use the [NSGA-II algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017).

Finally, we can simply iterate through the Pareto optimal set generated by the `eaMuPlusLambda` algorithm and print the results to the terminal.

### Conclusion
This project was an example of an application of an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm using the DEAP framework.
